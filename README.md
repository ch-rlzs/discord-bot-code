# discord-bot-code
The code for a Discord bot
which watches the Minecraft usernames you send it
and if it is available or (potentially) becomes available
It sends you a ping in DMs or a server, which you decide
It has a Bulk adding/removing option as well as a specific config you can change

If you would like to add this bot to your server, contact me at mclav on Discord
